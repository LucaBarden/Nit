# Nit - Not (G)it - VCS Client written in Kotlin
## Simple VCS inspired by my Kotlin implementation of the VCS Project while learning

While doing the project I kinda liked the idea to extend the project and see what it could end up with

This whole project is planned to be written in Kotlin

### Basic Usage:
```console
    ./build.sh
    kotlin ./Nit/build/libs/Nit.jar
```


### TODOS:
- Refactor Code
- Add Diff of Commits to Log (More Detailed Logs)
- Add Status Command to list unstaged Changes
- Add Possibility to add Folders (In Generall multiple Folders at once)
- Add Command to unstage Files again
- Add Command reset to reset changes that have been made

### DONE:
- Make Initialization a seperate Command
- Add Command to Remove `Nit` from a Folder again
- Changed some phrasing and naming of folders and files
