# Nit - Not (G)it - VCS Client written in Kotlin
## Simple VCS inspired by my Kotlin implementation of the VCS Project while learning

While doing the project I kinda liked the idea to extend the project and see what it could end up with

This whole project is planned to be written in Kotlin

### Basic Usage:
```console
    ./build.sh
    kotlin ./Nit/build/libs/Nit.jar
```


### TODOS:
- Refactor Code
- Add Diff of Commits to Log
- Add Stats Command to list unstaged Changes
- ...

### DONE:
- Make Initialization a seperate Command
- Add Command to Remove `Nit` from a Folder again
- Changed some phrasing and naming of folders and files
